# 2.1 JavaScript
# 2.1.1 The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language
- First class functions and closures
- Flexible object model
- Highly expressive object literal notation

- Lisp in C's Clothing

# 2.1.2 Evolving language
- ES2015 = ES6
- ECMAScript 2022

# 2.2 Declare variables
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Problems of `var`
1. `var` can be redeclared
2. Hoisting is allowed for `var`
3. Scope of `var` is function level

- `const` for the first choice
- If you need to reassign, use `let`
- Never use `var`
