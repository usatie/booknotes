#6-4. Deno
## 6-4-1. What is Deno?
### "Design Mistakes in Node" by Ryan Dahl
1. Not sticking with Promises
2. Security (V8 of itself is well secured sandbox, but Node.js is not)
3. The Build System (GYP)
4. package.json (centralized npm registry)
5. node_modules (module resolution algorithm is too complex)
6. require("module") without the extension ".js"
7. index.js (index.js can be omitted)

## 6-4-4. Deno can be used for production?
```
$ asdf plugin add deno
$ asdf install deno latest
$ asdf global deno latest
```
